# Pimp My Cause
Rebuild of the [Pimp My Cause](http://www.pimpmycause.org/) website. Powered by [Women Hack For Non Profits](womenhackfornonprofits.com)

## Set Up
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:womenhackfornonprofits/pimpmycause-rebuild.git`
2. Install [NPM](https://nodejs.org/) to manage packages.
3. Run `npm install` this will install all packages and the [Pencil Blue CMS](https://github.com/pencilblue/pencilblue/wiki/Quickstart:-Installation) CLI in the `package.json` file.
4. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
5. Install [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/install), if you have it already make sure it is up to date with `brew doctor`
5. Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) with `brew install mongodb`. 
6. Create the DB folder mongo needs to use `mkdir -p /data/db`

*Notes*: you might need to use `sudo`.

## Running on your local machine
To run the project on your local machine in the terminal:
`mongod` 
Then in a new terminal tab (or a new terminal on windows) run:
`nodemon main`

This will connect the application to your local mongo instance and will start the PencilBlue CMS. You will then be able to view it in your browser on [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/)


## Seeding your local database
1. `mongo`
Then in a new tab of the terminal follow the steps:
2. `use pimp_my_cause`
3. `load('./seeder.js')` you should get `ture` if there are no errors
4. `db.getCollectionNames()`
You should get a list of all the collections in the 'pimp_my_cause' database.

*Note*: You will need to go through these steps only when you want to reset your local
'pimp_my_cause' database. There is no need to run this every time you are working on the project.
